# Mirrored Information Uncertainty

This repository contains the matlab scripts used for research into the effects of uncertainty about world parameters on an information design problem. 
We consider cases where both the signaling designer and the agents receiving the signals are uncertain, which we call "mirrored" uncertainty. 
This problem is studied in the context of traffic along a single road, where V2V enabled cars are able to share information about road hazards, and the signaling designer controls the quality of the information that is shared.
